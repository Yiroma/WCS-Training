# WCS-Training

This repository includes lessons learned and exercises practiced at Wild Code School.

I took care to collect all the individual repositories in order to clean up my GitHub and gain readability.

The course was from February to July 2023.

My exam for the web and mobile web developer diploma took place in November 2023. I passed with an individual project.
